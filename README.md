## Dev Ramblings
As a solo developer I programmed, designed and QA tested this app. This represents my first Jetpack Compose app launched to the Google Play Store. I originally built the app to be used just by me to practice combos in Street Fighter 6. I then challenged myself to make the app into a product that could be launched on Google Play. The biggest challenge I faced was making sure the app UI could fit on a variety of devices, from big to small. 

Incorporating the principles of Material 3 design, I constructed the app, by taking ideas from my favorite apps. Youtube and Spotify served as inspiration due to their clean designs and intuitive use of modals, dialogs, floating action buttons, and top app bar. The font style and color palette were drawn from the captivating UI of Street Fighter 6 which lend to a vibrant and immersive vibe.
