## Dev Ramblings
I programmed, designed and tested the app as a solo developer. I wanted to create an app to showcase all that I have learned while working with Jetpack Compose. The idea came to me while playing Street Fighter 6. I leveraged the Jetpack Compose framework to design the app using Material 3 design principles. I added a lot of actions to the TopAppBar, similar to Youtube's TopAppBar. The BottomSheet modal designs were inspired by Spotify's BottomSheet. The typography and color were inspired by the UI in Street Fighter 6.
